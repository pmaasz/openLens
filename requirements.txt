# openlens Requirements
# Python 3.6+ required

# Core dependencies: None!
# All core functionality uses Python standard library only:
# - tkinter (GUI) - included with most Python installations
# - json (data storage) - standard library
# - datetime (timestamps) - standard library
# - os (file operations) - standard library
# - unittest (testing) - standard library

# Optional: 3D Visualization and Ray Tracing (recommended)
matplotlib>=3.3.0
numpy>=1.19.0

# Optional: Advanced Features
# Uncomment if you need these features:
# scipy>=1.5.0  # For advanced image simulation, diffraction calculations with Bessel functions
# Pillow>=8.0.0  # For image loading in image simulator

# Features requiring scipy:
# - Diffraction calculations (DiffractionCalculator) - uses Bessel functions
# - Image simulation with aberrations (ImageSimulator) - uses gaussian filters
# - Advanced image processing (zoom, sobel edge detection)
# Note: These modules gracefully degrade if scipy is not available

# Optional: Development tools (not required for application use)
# These are suggestions if you want additional development tools

# Code formatting
# black>=22.0.0

# Linting
# pylint>=2.12.0
# flake8>=4.0.0

# Type checking
# mypy>=0.950

# Testing enhancements
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=3.0.0

# Documentation generation
# sphinx>=4.5.0
